# Solana Counter App

A simple Solana counter app implemented using the Anchor framework.

## Description

This repository contains a basic Solana program that showcases how to create and interact with a counter on the Solana blockchain. The program includes two main functions:

- `initialize`: Initializes the counter with a value of 1.
- `increment`: Increments the counter value by 1 each time when this function is invoked.
